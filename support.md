# Support Policy 
We offer paying customers support on their use of our extensions, primarily by email. If needed, we might suggest other communication channels. <br/>
Our support is mainly focusing on answering questions, explaing and providing instructions on how customers can be successfull using our products. We do not do work or build solutions for customers as a part of our support. 

To initialize a support request, please send an email to <a href="mailto://extension-support@mskold.com">extension-support@mskold.com</a><br/>
If you require certain other communication channels then email or if you want us to build or do customizations for you, we can offer that as an additonal time and material based service.

<br/>

## Support for paying users 
For paid products and paying users we strive to deliver a top-notch support experience. Our goal is to start working on your tickets within a business day.

<br/>

## Support for non paying users
For non paying users we offer support on a best effort basis without any additional promises or guarantees.
The main channel for support is through the public Q&A sections on the extension or other public channels (GitHub Issues)<br/>
<br/>
We will always prioritize paying customers, and we have multiple free or open source extensions or projects we support then we have an chans.
